     * 4. We cannot create Object of an Interface,
     *      BUT we can create variable of Interface type.
     * 5. A class can implement one or more interface.
     *      when a class implements an Interface, means in the class.
     *      we give body to all abstract methods mentioned in Interface.
     * 6. By default, all variables are static and final in Interface.
     * 7. an Interface can extend another Interface.
     * 8. In the Interface, we can create methods with body but they will be static.
